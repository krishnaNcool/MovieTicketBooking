            <h2><a name='Toc515364572'></a>III. Definitions</h2>
            <p>The RLE Information Privacy Declaration is based on the terminology that was used by the European issuers of directives and regulations in adopting the General Data Protection Regulation (in German: Datenschutzgrundverordnung &#8212; DSGVO). Our Information Privacy Declaration must be easily readable and understandable both for the public as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to begin by defining the terminology we use.</p>
            <p>In this Information Privacy Declaration, we use the following terms amongst others:</p>
            <h4>a) Personal information</h4>
            <p>Personal information is all information that concerns an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”). A natural person is identifiable if the person can be directly or indirectly identified, especially through the assignment of an identifier such as a name, identification number, location information, on-line identifier or one or more specific characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person.</p>
            <h4>b) Data subject</h4>
            <p>A data subject is that identified or identifiable natural person whose personal information is processed by the processing controller responsible for the information.</p>
            <h4>c) Processing</h4>
            <p>Processing is any procedure or series of procedures, whether automated or not, associated with personal information, such as collecting, recording, organising, arranging, storing, adapting or changing, separating, retrieving, using, disclosing by transferring, disseminating or any other form of making available the comparison or link, restricting, deleting or erasing.</p>
            <h4>d) Restriction of processing</h4>
            <p>Restriction of processing is the tagging of stored personal information for the purpose of restricting future processing.</p>
            <h4>e) Profiling</h4>
            <p>Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal information that causes this personal information to be used to assess specific individual characteristics concerning a natural person, especially to analyse or predict this natural person’s characteristics regarding work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, residence or change of location.</p>
            <h4>f) Pseudonymisation</h4>
            <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal information in a manner in which the personal information can no longer be associated with a specific data subject without consultation of additional information, to the extent that this additional information is separately maintained and subject to technical and organisational measures that ensure that the personal information cannot be associated with an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
            <h4>g) Controller or processing controller</h4>
            <p>A controller or processing controller is a natural person or legal entity, authority, establishment or other place that makes decisions either solely or together with others regarding the purposes and means of processing personal information. If the purposes and means of this processing are prescribed by European Union law or the law of the Member States, the controller or the specific criteria for designating the controller can be provided in accordance with European Union law or the law of the Member States.</p>
            <h4>h) Processor</h4>
            <p>The processor is a natural person or legal entity, authority, establishment or other place that processes the personal information on behalf of the controller.</p>
            <h4>i) Recipient</h4>
            <p>A recipient is a natural person or legal entity, authority, establishment or other place to which personal information is disclosed, regardless whether this is a third party. Authorities who receive information that may be personal under specific mandates for investigation in accordance with European Union law or the law of the Member States are not, however, considered to be recipients.</p>
            <h4>j) Third party</h4>
            <p>A third party is a natural person or legal entity, authority, establishment or other place other than the data subject, controller, processor and the persons who are directly authorised by the controller or the processor to process personal information.</p>
            <h4>k) Consent</h4>
            <p>Consent is any expression of willingness provided for the specific case in an informed and unmistakeable way in the form of a statement or other clearly confirming action through which the data subject lets it be known that he or she agrees with the processing of the respective personal information.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>


            <h2><a name="_Toc515364573"></a>IV. General information on information processing</h2>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364574"></a>1. Scope of the processing of personal information</h3>
            <p>Your personal data (first name, family name, email address (professional), address (professional), phone number (professional)) are entered in a company-internal system (RLE SDP) and are available to the responsible persons within the RLE Group.</p>
            <p>Your data will be processed by our subcontractor in a data center in Germany. We have a contractual agreement with our subcontractor to protect your data. No data will be processed outside of Germany.</p>
            <p>We process the scope of personal data described above to provide the measures required to carry out our contractual obligations with our customers, which are conducted by your request.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364575"></a>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal information</h3>
            <p>If we obtain the data subject’s consent for the processing of personal information, European Union General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) Art. 6 Par. 1 letter a serves as the legal basis.</p>
            <p>If processing personal information is required to fulfil a contract to which the data subject is a contracting party, DSGVO Art. 6 Par. 1 letter b serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing procedures that are required to carry out pre-contractual measures.</p>
            <p>If the processing is required to safeguard a justified interest of our company or a third party and this interest is not outweighed by the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the data subject, DSGVO Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f serves as the legal basis.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364576"></a>3. Deletion of information and duration of storage</h3>
            <p>The personal information of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for which it was stored no longer exists. Storage can also take place if it has been provided for under European or national legislation in European Union legal regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. Blockage or deletion of the information can also take place if a storage period stipulated under the designated standards lapses unless there is a requirement for further storage of the information for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>


            <h2><a name="_Toc515364577"></a>V. Provision of the website and creation of log files</h2>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364578"></a>1. Description and scope of the processing of information</h3>
            <p>Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically records data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer.</p>
            <p>In this process, the following information is collected:</p>
            <p>(1) Information regarding browser type and the version used</p>
            <p>(2) The user’s IP address</p>
            <p>(3) Date and time of access</p>
            <p>(4) Query method, URL accessed and version of the HTTP protocol</p>
            <p>(5) Resulting value of the query (HTTP status code) and dimension of the request</p>
            <p>(6) Websites from which the user’s system accessed our website,</p>
            <p>(7) Websites that are accessed from the user’s system via our website</p>
            <p>The information is also stored in the log files of our system. Not included here are user’s IP addresses or other data that enable the information to be associated with a user. Storage of information together with other personal information pertaining to the user either does not take place or takes place only in an anonymised form.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364579"></a>2. Legal basis for the processing of information</h3>
            <p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of the information is DSGVO Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364580"></a>3. Purpose of the processing of information</h3>
            <p>The temporary storage of IP addresses by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the user’s computer. To do this, the user’s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>
            <p>Storage in the log files takes place to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the information helps us improve the website and ensure the security of our information systems technology. Assessment of the information for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>
            <p>For these purposes, our justified interest in the information processing is based on DSGVO Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364581"></a>4. Duration of storage</h3>
            <p>The information will be deleted as soon as the fulfilment of the purpose for which it was collected no longer requires this information. In the event that information is captured when the website is made available, this occurs when the respective session comes to an end.</p>
            <p>In the event that data is stored in log files, this occurs no later than 60 days after the session. Temporary storage is possible. In this case, the users’ IP addresses are deleted or altered such that it is no longer possible to associate these with the accessing client.</p>
            <h3><a name="_Toc515364582"></a>5. Opportunity for objection and removal</h3>
            <p>The recording of information when the website is made available and the storage of information in log files are essential to the operation of the website. For this reason, it follows that there is no opportunity for the user to raise an objection.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>

            <p>(2) if the processing is unlawful and you decline the deletion of personal information and instead demand the restriction of the use of the personal information;</p>
            <p>(3) if the controller no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of processing but you need it to assert, exercise or defend against legal claims, or</p>
            <p>(4) if you have lodged an objection against the processing in accordance with DSGVO Art. 21 Par. 1 and it remains uncertain whether the controller’s justified reasons outweigh your own reasons.</p>

            <p>(1) is required for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract between you and the controller,</p>
            <p>(2) is allowable based on legislation of the European Union or one of its Member States to which the controller is subject and this legislation contains reasonable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms as well as your justified interests or</p>
